**Couzin Model Swarm Simulation**

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Couzin Model for simulating and visualizing swarm behavior. The Couzin Model is a well-known framework used to study collective motion in biological systems, such as schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds of animals. The implementation visualizes how agents interact within a swarm based on local rules of repulsion, alignment, and attraction.

**Features**

Swarm Simulation: Simulate a group of agents (robots, animals, etc.) interacting based on the Couzin Model.
Visualization: Real-time animation of the swarm behavior using Matplotlib's quiver plot.
Modular Design: Easy-to-understand code structure with separate classes for the agent, swarm, and simulation.
Configurable Parameters: Adjust parameters like the number of agents, speed, interaction radii, and noise to explore different swarm dynamics.
