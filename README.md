Couzin Model Swarm Simulation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Couzin Model for simulating and visualizing swarm behavior. The Couzin Model is a well-known framework used to study collective motion in biological systems, such as schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds of animals. The implementation visualizes how agents interact within a swarm based on local rules of repulsion, alignment, and attraction.
